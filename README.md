# SparkMiniProject

This project explores a dataset containing information about YouTube trending videos and the dataset consists of a CSV file and a JSON file.

The objective of this project is to perform data cleaning and perform data exploration using PySpark SQL in DataBricks. 

I aim to extract insights from the dataset and perform analysis on different aspects such as category popularity, engagement patterns, and trends and create insights that answer key business questions using data visualisations.

## Usage

Run a compute in Databricks and import the interactive notebook file.

## Packages
```
import json
```
- Used to open the JSON file
